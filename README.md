# RLHF-ASR

A research framework for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) applied to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models.

## Overview

This project provides tools and scripts to fine-tune ASR models using RLHF techniques. It includes utilities for data processing, training, and evaluation, making it easy to experiment with advanced ASR training paradigms.

## Features

- Data reading and preprocessing utilities
- RLHF-based fine-tuning for ASR models
- Customizable training scripts
- Utilities for evaluation and analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- (Other dependencies as required)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

#### Fine-tuning an ASR Model

You can start fine-tuning using the provided script:

```bash
python finetune.py --config configs/your_config.yaml
```

Or use the shell script:

```bash
bash scripts/run_rlhf_asr.sh
```

#### Data Preparation

Place your training and evaluation data in the appropriate directory. Update paths in your config file as needed.

### Configuration

Edit the configuration YAML file to set hyperparameters, data paths, and model options.
